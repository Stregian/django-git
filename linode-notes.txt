Using ubuntu terminal in this note.


Getting it up and running. 
https://www.linode.com/docs/getting-started/

Linode stands for linux node. A node is a server in this case. 
In linode manager select your linode. This should take you to its dashboard. 
There are many tabs here, but select "deploy an image" button. 
Unless there's a good reason, use default settings with the latest Ubuntu.
Follow through user (root) and password creation, straightforward. 
"Host job queue" on the dashboard shows when OS installation is finished. 
Boot the linode with the dashboard button. Now it is up and running.
