Using ubuntu terminal in this note.


Getting it up and running. 
https://www.linode.com/docs/getting-started/

Linode stands for linux node. A node is a server in this case. 
In linode manager select your linode. This should take you to its dashboard. 
There are many tabs here, but select "deploy an image" button. 
Unless there's a good reason, use default settings with the latest Ubuntu.
Follow through user (root) and password creation, straightforward. 
"Host job queue" on the dashboard shows when OS installation is finished. 
Boot the linode with the dashboard button. Now it is up and running. 


Logging in first time and setting up SSH.

Your linode's public IP is in the "remote access" tab. 
In terminal run "ssh root@<public IP>", answer yes to the security query to get in. 
You are now accessing the linode. Yay. Terminal should now show root@<linode's public IP>:~#

Make a non-root user using "adduser <name>". Follow prompts for details.
"adduser <name> sudo" for admin power. 
Change to <name> using su <name>. You should now see <name>@<linode's public IP>:~# in terminal

SSH (Secure SHell) connection to linode 
Open another terminal on your local machine. In your user directory.
Check for local ssh keys using "ls ~/.ssh". There may already be a key pair.
If not, generate a key using "ssh-keygen -b 4096". Either enter through, or add passphrase, depending on how you feel.
Copy the public key generated to the linode using "ssh-copy-id <name>@<linode's pubilc IP>"
Now you should be able to exit and re-enter the linode using ssh rather than passwords.
