Once machine is up and running install virtualenv for python. 
To make a virtualenv, simply run "virtualenv <environment/project name>"
(<env>) should appear by your terminal user, this is how you know you're in the virtualenv.
to escape, "deactivate"
to re-enter "source <virtualenv directory>/bin/activate"

Once everything is up and running properly, it is worth running "pip freeze" to create a requirements.txt.
This can be used, "pip install -r requirements.txt". So far as I know it can have it's name changed.
